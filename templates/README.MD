The six XML files in this folder are templates for reading OSMM Topopgrahic layer GML files using OpenJump JAVA API:
  - osmm_ta.xml: template for TopographicArea features
  - osmm_tl.xml: template for TopographicLine features
  - osmm_tp.xml: template for TopographicPoint features
  - osmm_cs.xml: template for CartographicSymbol features
  - osmm_ct.xml: template for CartographicText features
  - osmm_bl.xml: template for BoundaryLine features

You may also use these templates to load OSMM GML data via OpenJUMP GUI, if you replace the original OpenJUMP JAR with the modified version in JAR folder.
